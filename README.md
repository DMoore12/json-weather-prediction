json-weather-prediction is an application that will intake a .json file and output probability of a thunderstorm based on the data inside. It will be designed for use on a Raspberry Pi terminal, but will hopefully be available for more than just this use. It's initial production was designed for use with the [HyperStation](https://github.com/russelltg/weatherstation).
